People loved him early on because he's fun and balls out, completely turned on him and said he deserved to be moved on from because he wasn't actually that good and buying into the 'childish'/douche stuff and like angry at him for playing through injury, then he had that crazy Rams game and everyone decided they were back on board and liking his spunky attitude.\n",

      "Comment: Wideouts fake towards stepping out of bounds all the time. It’s different to kneel down but keep your knee an inch above the ground (which would be abusing this, but likely would just be ruled down) and to juke, even with a slide. Once the slide starts, there’s no going back. And players are allowed to make a play towards the qb until he commits to the slide.\n",

      "Comment: Players are absolutely allowed to hit the qb until they commit to the slide, but with how fast these guys are moving it is frequent that when the defense thinks the qb is sliding they let up (because if they don’t they are basically a missile and it will be too late, and they will be flagged). Some quarterbacks have tried to take advantage of this by continuing to run.\n",
